    "# 7. Conclusion and Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "7.1 Conclusion\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, we embarked on a journey to forecast electricity demand using LSTM models. The major steps and findings include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Preparation: Our initial focus was on importing and cleaning the dataset. We successfully handled missing values and outliers, ensuring the data's quality for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling: We chose LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network, recognizing its prowess in understanding sequences and predicting time series data. Our model's structure included multiple LSTM layers interspersed with Dropout layers to reduce overfitting. The results we achieved in terms of MSE and RMSE provided evidence of the model's robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance Evaluation: Upon evaluating the model, it became evident that the LSTM was capable of capturing the trend and seasonality of the electricity demand. However, there were areas where the model could be enhanced further for better accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "24-hour Forecasting: The utility of our model was highlighted when we successfully predicted electricity demand for the upcoming 24 hours, demonstrating its potential real-world application.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.2 Future Work\n",
    "While our model showed promising results, there are several avenues that can be explored to improve its performance and utility:\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Enhancement: By experimenting with different architectures like GRU or bidirectional LSTMs, or by tuning hyperparameters more intensively using techniques like GridSearch or RandomizedSearch, we could potentially enhance our model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Engineering: Incorporating additional features like weather data (temperature, humidity), public holidays, or special events can provide more contextual information to the model, possibly improving accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble Methods: Combining the strengths of multiple models using ensemble techniques might yield better results. For instance, combining forecasts from ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM can give more robust predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploying the Model: For real-world utility, the next step would be to deploy the model as a web service or integrate it within an electricity management system to provide real-time forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expand the Time Horizon: While our focus was on 24-hour forecasts, the model can be trained to predict demands over longer horizons, say, a week or even a month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback Loop: Once deployed, it's essential to establish a feedback loop where the model's predictions are constantly compared against real outcomes, enabling iterative refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the work done in this notebook lays the foundation for a comprehensive electricity demand forecasting system. With further refinements and the right integrations, such a system can greatly assist in efficient energy management and planning."
